# rock-paper-scissors

- There was no need for computer results in startRound function. Else would do just fine.

- It is best if I would have declared a variable for startRound function inside game function.
  Since we will be taking the result of playRound 5 times, it should be declared inside for loop.

- I have overcomplexed the game even tho it is simple. Declarations such as roundWinner etc. are not necessary.
